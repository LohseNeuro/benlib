# To recompile on linux:

mex glmnetMex.F GLMnet.f

# Re 64-bit linux: We (Alex Ivanov, Ben Willmore) found that the Stanford-
# compiled glmnetMex.mexa64 failed on some big datasets (with a segmentation
# fault). We found that we could fix this on Ubuntu 18.04 by recompiling. 
# The current version of glmnetMex.mexa64 is the result of that compilation
# but does not work at all on older versions of Ubuntu. Recompiling on older
# Ubuntu (14.04 / 16.04) didn't fix the crash on those platforms.

# If you are using an older version of Ubuntu, move glmnetMex.mexa64.14.04 to
# glmnetMex.mexa64. But be aware that it will crash on certain datasets.
